## Mr. Tim Yang's Data Science Homework
## Due 9/29/2015

This document outlines responses for homework 1. 

Look at the head and the tail, and think for a minute about how the data is structured. What do you think each column means? What do you think each row means? Tell me! (If you're unsure, look at more of the file contents.)

1a. The Chipotle File is a table that collects data on customer order history. Column 1 represents the customer's order number, and there may be two rows with the same order_id representing two items on one receipt. Quantity is just the # of items for that row, item_name is the Chipotle menu item, and choice_description lists all of the condiments for the menu item. Each row is a  single food item type. For example, If I was the 30th customer and I ordered 2 burritos and 1 drink, the dataset would list two rows. Row 1 would have order_id 30, item_name burrito, quantity 2. Row 2 would have order_id30, item_name drink, quantity1.

1b. There are 1834 orders, since the largest number in column "order_id" is 1834.

1c. There are 4623 lines in the file. In GitHub, the file contains 4623 rows. https://github.com/vybstat/dat9/blob/master/data/chipotle.tsv#L33

1d. There are 591 chicken burritos, and only 386 steak burritos. Therefore, chicken is more popular.

1e.
