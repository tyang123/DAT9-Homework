*What is the question you hope to answer?

The question I'm hoping to answer is, What colleges are POSITIVE return on investment,
and which colleges are NEGATIVE return on investments for low-income, single parent,minority, urban high school students? 

The social phenomenon I'm trying to "hack" is the concept of "undermatching", 
where top low-income students do not apply to elite private schools because of perceived cost/underqualification.


*What data are you planning to use to answer that question?
The data I will use is the White House scorecard data available at  https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/

*What do you know about the data so far?
I have a data Dictionary, and know that the data contains 18 years of institutional, financial, geographic
and cultural information on colleges in the United States.

*Why did you choose this topic?
It is unacceptable to witness the low expectations placed by guidance counselors in low income communities.
I believe high achieving low-income students get preyed upon by low-performing colleges who steal their tuition
and financial aid dollars. 

Public school teachers do not have the capability to understand private capital markets, and guidance counselors
are not compensated or incentivized to maximize the college opportunities for their students. In an affluent,
highly-educated zip code, the college market understands the premium of a high ranking university.
In a low-income, less educated culture, the adults do not price the premium of a branded college accordingly and
are capping the potential of these students.

In order to ensure economic outcomes for all American children, we need a analytics, data-driven classification engine
to reveal the truth about the immense value/affordability of a private, elite university degree, and to direct students
away from predatory universities that do not serve the public good and do not support acceptable levels of student graduation.
